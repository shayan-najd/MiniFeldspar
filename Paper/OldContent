"Good artists copy, great artists steal." --- Picasso

Domain specific embedded languages are great: they steal the type
system of the host language.  This paper presents quoted domain
specific languages, which are greater still: they steal the type
system and syntax of the host language, and exploit a normaliser for
the quoted expressions that can be reused between many implementations
of embedded languages.
-----------------------------
-- Higher-order is the secret sauce of functional programming.
Many embedded domain specific languages, such as Feldspar, Hydra, and
Nicola, benefit from allowing programmers to exploit higher-order
features while generating efficient first-order code.
The reason this works is Gentzen's \emph{subformula property}, which gaurantees that higher-order constructs


-----------------------------
Sometimes a detour is the shortest way to one's destination.
Often, a concept can be most concisely expressed using higher-order
functions, eventhought, the final result is first-order.
Many embedded domain specific languages, such as Feldspar, Hydra, and
Nicola, benefit from allowing programmers to exploit higher-order
features while generating efficient first-order code.
They achieve this by utilizing the evaluator of the host language;
We achieve it by using a normaliser instead. Our normaliser is gauranteed to work because of the theorems depending on subformula property.

We present a new approach to implementing embedded domain specific languages based on quotations called QDSLs (Quoted DSLs).
