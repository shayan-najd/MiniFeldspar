We summarise a standard way to engineer domain-specific languages by
combining deep and shallow embedding, and describe a new technique
which we call \emph{quoted domain specific languages}, comparing and
contrasting the two.  We abbreviate the former as EDSL,
and the latter as QDSL.

We propose QDSL, a new way to define domain-specific languages,
and contrast it with EDSL based on the traditional combination of
deep and shallow embedding used in systems such as Feldspar
\citep{feldspar} and Nicola \citep{nicola}.

It has become common to write embedded domain-specific
languages (EDSLs) using a combination of deep and shallow
embedding

Do you prefer to build a domain-specific language using shallow
embedding, deep embedding, or a combination of the two?
This paper offers a new way---quoted domain-specific languages.
For brevity, we write EDSL for embedded domain specific language
(usually with a combination of deep and shallow embedding), and
QDSL for quoted domain specific language.
