To Do list.

* Revise Abstract

* Revise Sections 2, 3, 4
   - Add FO
   - Add mention of TH.Q and TH.Exp

* Finish Section 5 (Subformula property)

* Finish Section 6 (Implementation and Evaluation)

* Finish Section 8 (Conclusion)

  - Paragraph: apply subformula property to use Maybe in CDSL,
      make toArr, fromArr explicit?
  - Paragraph: design of general QDSL library for Haskell
  - Paragraph: current typed quasi-quotes loose too much type information.
      Need to recover this to support overloading.
  - Rousing concluding line!

* IF TIME PERMITS

  - Repackage each subsection of Section 2 as three files. Get rid of subscripts.

  - Replace CDSL by something better?

  - Think of a new title for paper?

  - There is a lot of prelude material. Review with Shayan.
