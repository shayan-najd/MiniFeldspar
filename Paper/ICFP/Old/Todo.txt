% TO DO

% Shayan, I especially need the following from you. Either send in
% e-mail or edit the paper. If you edit the paper, mark changes with
% *** SHAYAN ***
% before and after.

% Shayan: Add a short explanation of the type class Type. In order for
% the code in the paper to be correct, I suspect that we need to explain
% how Type relates to Ref.

% Shayan: Check that all the C code in the paper is indeed generated
% by the code given in the paper. Particularly, check this for Section
% 2.6, where the C code is new.

% Shayan: A short explanation of how overloading works in the QDSL
% Feldspar implementation.


% Possible additional things to do?

% Possibly, introduce class Type and explain how it relates
% to Rep?  If done, may need to move some explanation of Arr
% from 2.6 to 2.1.

% Possibly, eliminate non-CSE results from Figure 1?


% Partly done: should I do more?

% More discussion of Cheney-et-al-2013
% especially in regard to subformula property.

% More discussion of type-based quotation

% Make more clear that main contribution
% is the application of subformula property to DSLs.
